canvas-charts
=============

A micro JS library to render charts using only html5 canvas. Additional graph types will be supported via plugins that use the core drawing package. The ultimate goal for this library is to not do what full-fledged graph libraries like flot and gRaphael do but in fact to support a small need for a library (that can generate "pretty" graphs) that doesn't suck in terms of size and performance. If you can help with this project and would like to discuss more about it, feel free to contact me.
